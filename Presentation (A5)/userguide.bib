@inproceedings{Varghese2014,
    abstract = { With energy efficiency and power consumption being the
                 primary impediment in the path to exascale systems, low-power
                 high performance embedded systems are of increasing
                 interest. The Parallella System-on-module (SoM) created by
                 Adapteva combines the Epiphany-IV 64-core coprocessor with a
                 host ARM processor housed in a Zynq System-on-chip. The
                 Epiphany integrates low-power RISC cores on a 2D mesh
                 network and promises up to 70 GFLOPS/Watt of processing
                 efficiency. However, with just 32 KB of memory per eCore for
                 storing both data and code, and only low level inter-core
                 communication support, programming the Epiphany system
                 presents several challenges. In this paper we evaluate the
                 performance of the Epiphany system for a variety of basic
                 compute and communication operations. Guided by this data we
                 explore various strategies for implementing stencil based
                 application codes on the Epiphany system. With future
                 systems expected to house 4096 eCores, the merits of the
                 Epiphany architecture as a path to exascale is compared to
                 other competing power efficient systems.
