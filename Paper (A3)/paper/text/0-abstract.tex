\begin{abstract}
	The performance and energy efficiency provided by \lws is
	undeniable. However, the lack of rich and portable support for
	these processors makes software development challenging. In this work,
	we propose a portable and lightweight
	MPI library (\lwmpi) designed from scratch to
	cope with the intricacies of \lws. We integrated \lwmpi
	into a distributed OS that targets these processors
	and evaluated it on the \mppa processor. Results obtained with three applications
	from a representative benchmark suite unveiled that \lwmpi achieves similar
	performance scalability in comparison with a low-level vendor-specific API narrowed
	for MPPA-256, while exposing a richer programming interface.
